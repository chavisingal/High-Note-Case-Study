## Introduction

The “freemium” business model — widely used by online services such as LinkedIn, Match.com,
Dropbox, and music-listening sites — divides user populations into groups that use the service
for free and groups that pay a fee for additional features. Key points related to the freemium
model:
* Free accounts are monetized using online advertising
* Premium subscribers (those paying a fee) are typically 24 times more profitable than free
users
* However, premium subscribers are rare
High Note is an anonymized real music streaming company --- similar to Last.fm, Spotify or
Pandora --- that uses a freemium business model.

## Objective
Given the higher profitability of premium subscribers, it is generally in the interest of company
to motivate users to go from “free to fee”; that is, convert free accounts to premium
subscribers. My task in regards to this case is to analyze the data for potential insight to inform
a “free-to-fee” strategy.

Literature shows that peer influence and user engagement can affect users’ decisions to pay for
a premium subscription. Using the High Note data, I can thus predict the decision to buy using
both types of variables. The results will quantify the effect of social engagement on revenue, as
well as how valuable a premium subscriber can be in a freemium social community.
